Priorities:
app and useAuth can have duplicate code related to creating session (highly possible: app logic work for direct access if user logged in and useAuth only work for fresh login or signIn)
logoutButton and useAuth (handleLogout) can have duplicate code (specially navigation)




Test changes:
used authLoading in navbar  // done
added unique username generation in useAuth
-> changed the navigation route after login/signin


Confusions:
confusion in "/" and "/home" routes
where used setTimeout for navigation




Tasks:
Add caching in files where required (specially in AllPosts page)
Add reply to comment feature (optional)
Add likes  to show all users who liked a post  // done
-> Clean the navbar
